If your ESP8266 project has Internet access, you can obtain date and time for FREE via the Network Time Protocol (NTP). 

NTP is an abbreviation for Network Time Protocol. It is a standard Internet Protocol (IP) for synchronizing computer clocks over a network.
This protocol synchronizes all networked devices to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) within a few milliseconds ( 50 milliseconds over the public Internet and under 5 milliseconds in a LAN environment).
